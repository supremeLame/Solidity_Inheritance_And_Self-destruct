Simple Smart Contract Inheritance and Self-destruct
======
**Simple Smart Contract Inheritance and Self-destruct usage** is a simple smart contract that demonstrates the use of Inheritance and Self-Destruct. The  selfdestruct keyword when executed properly renders inoperable a smart contract. The wrap up is, selfdestruct is designed to be the extrema ratio for a malfunctioning contract. It is the emergency button, the SCRAM of your smart contract. Still, before calling it, consider adding additional logic to, for example, pass control to another smart contract.

Inheritance is a way to extend functionality of a contract. Solidity supports both single as well as multiple inheritance. In this example we seperate the functionality of the contract owner from the basic contract and add an extra layer of security by making the self-destruct function accessible only to the owner.
